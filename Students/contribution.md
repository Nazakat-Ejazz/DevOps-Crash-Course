# Blogs , I have written
   Hitherto,I have written two blogs(third on the way).They are posted over medium.com.My course instructor "Mr Saim Safdar" is my motivation , without him I would not    have realized the importance of showing your work to world , by making a digital presence.
   
  ## 1. Vagrant , an alternative to Docker?
   In this blog I have tried to clear out the confusion that exits especially with those new to DevOps.I have described the two tools in an easy and understandable        way and enlightened different aspects of them and have tried to make a comparison of the their performance.
